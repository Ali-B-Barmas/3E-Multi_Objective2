# 3E-Multi_Objective2
3E Analysis of a Multi-Objective Cycle Integrating RO and MED Systems, completed in January 2024.

This project involves conducting a 3E (Energy, Exergy, Economic) Analysis of a multi-objective cycle integrating MED, RO, and other components using MATLAB.

Overview:

    Key aspects of the project:
    * Conducted Energy, Exergy, and Economic (3E) analysis of a multi-objective cycle.
    * Integrated a MED and RO into the system.
    * Coupled with Rankine and Single-Flash geothermal cycles.
    * The project validates the paper:
      Exergoeconomic analysis of a geothermal steam turbine combined with
      multi-effect desalination and reverse osmosis
      Aida Farsi, Marc A. Rose
    * Refprop used for thermophysical properties of working fluids.
    
Features:
    * Validates a comprehensive 3E analysis from a published research paper.
    * Models power and desalination systems.
    * Simulates the thermodynamic performance of multiple cycles using MATLAB.
